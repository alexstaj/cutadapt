"""%prog [options] <FASTA/FASTQ FILE> [<QUALITY FILE>]

Reads a FASTA or FASTQ file, finds and removes adapters,
and writes the changed sequence to standard output.
When finished, statistics are printed to standard error.

If two file names are given, they are assumed to be
.csfasta and .qual files as produced by the SOLiD sequencer.
(You still need to provide the -c option to correctly deal
with color space.)

If the name of any input or output file ends with '.gz', it is
assumed to be gzip-compressed.

If you want to search for the reverse complement of an adapter, you must
provide an additional adapter sequence using two '-a' parameters.

If the input sequences are in color space, the adapter must
also be provided in color space (using a string of digits 0123).

EXAMPLE

Assuming your sequencing data is available as a FASTQ file, use this
command line:
$ cutadapt -e ERROR-RATE -a ADAPTER-SEQUENCE input.fastq > output.fastq"""

Interpreting the result of a semiglobal alignment between the adapter and the read sequences

There are nine cases, which can be grouped into four categories.

A: character of the adapter sequence (r1)
R: character of the read sequence    (r2)
-: gap symbol

The middle of the alignment is always like this:
AAAA
RRRR

For the part of that is before the middle and for the part that is after the middle,
there are three possibilities each (making 3*3=9)

A  and -  and  'nothing'
-      R

Grouping by semantics of those alignments, we get the following three categories.


1. The adapter covers or parts of it cover the entire read
