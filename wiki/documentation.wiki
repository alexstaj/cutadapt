<wiki:toc max_depth="2" /> 

Please see the [http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/source/browse/trunk/README README file] included with cutadapt, which is the main documentation.

= References =

Cutadapt can be cited as follows:
M. Martin. [http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200 Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads]. EMBnet.journal, North America, 17, May 2011. Available at: [http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200] .

Cutadapt was used for the paper [http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/gkq342v1 Deep sequencing reveals differential expression of microRNAs in favorable versus unfavorable neuroblastoma] by Schulte et al (2010).

A preliminary version was used for [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp054 Massive parallel bisulfite sequencing of CG-rich DNA fragments reveals that methylation of many X-chromosomal CpG islands in female blood DNA is incomplete] by Zeschnigk et al. (2009).


= Installation =

Starting with version 0.9, cutadapt is [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cutadapt listed in the Python Package Index]. You can therefore install it with:
{{{
easy_install cutadapt
}}}
or, if you have [http://pip.openplans.org/ pip] installed, with: 
{{{
pip install cutadapt
}}}



= (Frequently) Asked Questions =

== `SyntaxError` ==
If you get this error:
{{{
  File "./cutadapt", line 85
    DOUBLE_ENCODE_TRANS = maketrans(b'0123.', b'ACGTN')
}}}
or this error:
{{{
   File "./cutadapt", line 62
    print("# There are %7d sequences in this data set." % stats.n, file=outfile)
                                                                       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
}}}
Then your Python is too old. At least Python 2.6 is needed for cutadapt.

== gcc failed with exit status 1 ==

If you get this error:
{{{
running build
running build_py
running build_ext
building 'calign' extension
gcc -pthread -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -fPIC -I/usr/include/python2.6 -c calignmodule.c -o
build/temp.linux-i686-2.6/calignmodule.o

calignmodule.c:42: error: expected ‘)’ before string constant
calignmodule.c:80: error: expected ‘=’, ‘,’, ‘;’, ‘asm’ or ‘__attribute__’

calignmodule.c:263: error: expected ‘=’, ‘,’, ‘;’, ‘asm’ or ‘__attribute__’

calignmodule.c:269: error: expected ‘=’, ‘,’, ‘;’, ‘asm’ or ‘__attribute__’
before ‘initcalign’
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
}}}
Then you need to install the appropriate Python development packages. In Ubuntu, this is done with {{{sudo aptitude install python-dev}}}.
